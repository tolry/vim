# personal vim configuration

This is my personal configuration, lots of stuff shamelessly stolen from @beberlei, @davidbadura and @dragonito. Feel free to use as convenient!

## requirements

* vim8+

## installation

* clone to `~/.vim`
* `ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`
* start vim once
    * vim-plug is downloaded
    * plugins are automatically downloaded
    * on this vim run a few errors might appear (colorscheme not yet available etc.(
    * everything should work fine afterwards
* customize your installation by creating a file `~/.vimrc.local`
